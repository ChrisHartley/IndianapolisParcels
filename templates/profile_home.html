        Welcome {{ user.first_name }},</br>
        Thank you for your interest in Renew Indianapolis and our properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Renew Indianapolis exists to return chronically vacant and abandoned property to productive use. We
        accept donated properties and work with the City of Indianapolis on select city-owned properties. View
        our complete, up to date, inventory on <a href="https://www.renewindianapolis.org/search-map/">our property map</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our online application is free, with no application fee, and we welcome interested buyers of all
        types—individuals, non-profit organizations, and for-profit corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Get started on an application by clicking "Start a New Application" or resume work on an existing
        application by clicking "edit" next to the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        We consider applications on a rolling basis.  Our monthly deadline is typically the 2nd Friday of the month
        (3rd Friday of the month when a month contains 5 Thursdays).  Applications seeking to rehabilitate an
        existing structure or to construct a new structure require a scope of work, outlining the improvements to
        be made to the site, and proof of funds, demonstrating the capacity to complete the proposed scope of
        work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Request a visit to a property to prepare your scope of work by clicking the "Request A Property Visit" button.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please see <a href="https://www.renewindianapolis.org/view-our-policies/">our policies and proceedures page</a>.
