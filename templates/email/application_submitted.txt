Hello {{ user }},

Thank you for submitting your application for {{ Property.streetAddress }}, parcel # {{ Property.parcel }}. Your application will be reviewed by our staff
within the next several days. If we need any additional information from you we will be in touch, otherwise your application will be reviewed by our
Review Committee.

If you have questions or would like to modify your application, please contact chris.hartley@renewindianapolis.org.

Our applications go through a multi-step approval process:
1) Staff review for completeness, schedule for Review Committee (deadline is two Fridays before the last Thursday of the month)
2) Review Committee (last Thursday of the month) where they can recommend for approval, not recommend for approval, or table for further information
3) Board of Directors (first Thursday of the month) where they can approve, not approve, or table for further information
4) The Indianapolis Department of Metropolitan Development can accept or deny the recommendations of the Board of Directors
5) The Metropolitan Development Commission (second Wednesday of the month), appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and the City-County Council votes
to give final approval.
6) We send a purchase agreement to the title company of your choosing and they begin preparing the title work and removing any trash or weed liens on the title.
This can take anywhere from one to several weeks, depending on the property and title company. Once the title company notifies us that they are ready to close we
will contact you to schedule a day and time that works for everyone.


Thank you for your application,

Renew Indianapolis
